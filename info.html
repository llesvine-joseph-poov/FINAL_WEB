            <h2>Rules & How to Play</h2>
            <p>On a square board with 64 alternating-color squares, chess is played. Each player has 16 pieces to work with at the start of the game, including a king, a queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which occurs when the king is under check and cannot be removed from the threat of capture with a legal move by the opponent.</p>
